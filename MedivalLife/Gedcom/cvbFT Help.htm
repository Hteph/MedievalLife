    </ul>
   <h2><a name=1_2></a>1.2 Technical Overview<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>cvbFT is built on Microsoft Excel.  It was originally developed on MS Excel 2003 but modifications in v4.04 and later have only been tested using Excel 2007 (and Excel 2010) running on Windows 7. Although new features may run on older versions of Excel and Windows, they are no longer specifically tested and are not officially supported so you are on your own if you try!!</p>
   <h2><a name=1_3></a>1.3 Changes Since Previous Versions<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>

     </ul>
    <h3>v3.04 (September 2009):</h3>
     <p>This release includes a fix to compile errors being experienced by some (but curiously, not all) users. <i>For the more technically minded this was caused by a spurious reference to RefEdit.dll that is not required.</i></p>
    <h3>v3.03 (August 2009):</h3>
     <p>Included a couple of suggested improvements:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Fixed a problem that caused an error when upgrading from a version older than 2.06.</li>

      <li>Improvement to the generated HTML for the &lsquo;Individual&rsquo pages of the exported web site reducing their size.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>v3.01 (September 2008):</h3>
     <p>This is a significant new release that includes the following:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Much of the software has been reviewed and tidied up resulting in a number of performance improvements.</li>
      <li>The management of <a href='#3_3_2'>user preferences</a> has been tidied up. Preferences are now divided into a number of groups - Application, GEDCOM, Living Persons & Web - making it easier to find the required feature.</li>
      <li>The way in which preferences are <a href='#4_3'>stored</a> has been updated.</li>
      <li>Additional <a href='#3_3_2_1'>screen display modes</a> are now available.</li>
      <li>The colours and font used for generated web pages can be <a href='#3_3_2_5'>modified</a>.</li>
      <li>A personalised header can now be <a href='#3_3_2_4'>specified</a> for the generated web pages.</li>
      <li>A meta description and and meta keywords can be <a href='#3_3_2_4'>specified</a> for inclusion in the front page to improve web search indexing and display.</li>
      <li>More &lsquo;style&rsquo; information has been moved to stylesheets, reducing the size of generated HTML by around 5% (actual reduction depends on many factors and will vary depending on actual family tree content).</li>
      <li>Input validation has been improved to help ensure data quality.</li>
      <li>The application appearance has been updated.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>v2.09 (May 2008):</h3>
     <p>A maintenence release that addresses a small number of inconsistencies in the display of information.</p>
    <h3>v2.08 (April 2008):</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>A progress message is displayed during the creation of a GEDCOM file for export.</li>
     <li>The html text and css stylesheets that are created by the web export have been improved to work correctly with a wider variety of browsers.</li>
     <li>A new facility to enable users to add and use additional types of event.  See the function <a href='#3_3_3'>description</a> for further details.</li>
     <li>The ability to change the sequence of the items in the list of sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>v2.07 was never officially released</h3>
    <h3>v2.06 (June 2007):</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Some minor problems caused when parts of the database (eg. Sources list) had not been populated have been resolved</li>
     <li>A problem where the wrong colour was used when displaying a Tree on a Web Page for a male without a partner has been corrected.  The tree will need to be re&ndash;exported for the change to take effect.</li>
     <li>Photos and Documents can now be retrieved from any location within the computer&rsquo;s file management system and when exported to a web site are always stored in a single folder.</li>
     <li>Non&ndash;graphic Documents (eg html and MS Word files) can now be viewed when using the View Person function</li>
     <li>Audio and Video files can be added to a person&rsquo;s record.</li>
     <li>&lsquo;Same Sex&rsquo; partnerships are now supported.  Although there is little evidence in historical documentation, these relationships are increasingly recognised today.  There are some limitations on certains functions within the application and these are noted where relevant.</li>
     <li>An additional value of &lsquo;Unspecified&rsquo; is now available for the Sex attribute of a person.  This can be used where the sex of a person is not known or an individual chooses not to be classified as Male or Female.  There are some limitations on certains functions within the application and these are noted where relevant.</li>
     <li>An option is available to enable &lsquo;Auto&ndash;save&rsquo;.  If turned On, this option will immediately save data to the computer&rsquo;s file storage system whenever significant data is added or changed.</li>
     <li>The size of exported web pages has been reduced by the use of Casading Style Sheets.  Although the size reduction can be impacted by various factors, such as the number of photos included on web pages, a size saving of 10% is achievable.</li>
     <li>An option to produce a simplified GEDCOM export is available.  This is intended to allow the exported file to be used by other applications that do not support all of the complexities of the full GEDCOM standard such as date ranges, multiple occupations and addresses, source citations etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>v2.05 (April 2007):</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>A problem with the display of long captions for photos and documents was fixed.</li>
     <li>A block of text can now be entered for use as an introduction/overview on the &lsquo;Family Index&rsquo; (home) page when publishing to HTML Web pages.</li>
     <li>Up to 3 items can now be specified for inclusion on the menu that appears on the &lsquo;Family Index&rsquo; (home) page when publishing to HTML Web pages.</li>
     <li>The list of other events in a person&rsquo;s record can be re&ndash;sequenced to suit your requirements.</li>
     <li>Some &lsquo;ease of use&rsquo; improvements were made to aid management of the source list for a data item.</li>
     <li>A problem with linking non&ndash;graphic documents (eg. html) to a record was addressed.  Non&ndash;graphic images can only be viewed when the database is exported to HTML web pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many thanks to the users of the application for their feedback and enhancement suggestions.</p>
  <h1><a name=2></a>2 Installation<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h1>
   <p>The downloaded zip file should be unpacked using either the standard windows extract facility or available software such as WinZip.  The package contains 8 files &ndash; this help file (cvbFT Help.htm), the main application file (cvbFT v4.03.xls) and 6 small graphic (.jpg) files that are used by the application.  These should all be located in the same Windows folder.  The main application file can be renamed but changing the name of the other files (or deleting them) will prevent the application from working correctly and cause errors.</p>
   <h2><a name=2_1></a>2.1 Macro Security<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>A &lsquo;self&ndash;signed Digital Certificate&rsquo; is attached to the cvbFT macros and can be installed on your PC to avoid being prompted to allow these macros to run every time the aplication is used. The process for installing depends on the version of Excel that you are running.</p>
    <h3><a name=2_1_1></a>2.1.1 Excel 2003<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>Excel macro security should be set to high or medium (a lower setting is not generally recommended) or the application will not function correctly.  To check this, from the Excel &lsquo;Tools&rsquo; menu, select &lsquo;Macro&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Security...&rsquo; and check that High or Medium is selected.</p>
     <p>To install the certificate:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Open cvbFT in Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>When you get the Security Warning, click on the &lsquo;Details&rsquo; button.</li>
      <li>The Digital Signature Details window should be displayed &ndash; click on the &lsquo;View Certicate&rsquo; button</li>
      <li>The Certificate window is displayed &ndash; click on &lsquo;Install Certificate&rsquo;</li>
      <li>Click &lsquo;Next&rsquo; on the next 2 windows and then &lsquo;Finish&rsquo;</li>
      <li>Click &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; on the Security Warning window and then click OK when the certificate has been installed</li>
      <li>Click &lsquo;OK&rsquo; on both the Certificate and Digital Signature Details windows to close them</li>
      <li>Click the &lsquo;Disable Macros&rsquo; button on the Security Warning window</li>
      <li>cvbFT should start.  Do not try to use it but shut it down using the Close option on the Excel File menu</li>
      <li>Re&ndash;open cvbFT.  This time, the option &lsquo;Always trust macros from this publisher.&rsquo; is enabled &ndash; tick the box and then click on the &lsquo;Enable Macros&rsquo; button.</li>

   <h2><a name=2_2></a>2.2 First use<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>When a newly installed application file is first opened, the current directory is scanned for earlier versions of the application that contain family tree data.  If one is found, you are asked if you want to import the data into the new  version.  See the section on <a href='#3_6'>Upgrade</a> for further details of how this works.</p>
   <h2><a name=2_3></a>2.3 Switching between Windows XP and Vista (and vice versa)<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>The default folder names used by Windows XP and Vista are different and there are various parts of the cvbFT &lsquo;database&rsquo; that need to be modified to reflect this. Typically, Windows XP uses path names such as &lsquo;C:\Documents and Settings\{username}\My Documents\...&rsquo; and &lsquo;C:\Documents and Settings\{username}\My Documents\My Pictures...&rsquo; while Vista uses &lsquo;C:\Users\{username}\Documents\...&rsquo; and &lsquo;C:\Users\{username}\Pictures\...&rsquo;. As there is no guaranteed way of predicting exactly where pictures, documents and other multimedia are actually stored, it is safer to make these changes manually. To accomplish this, please follow these instructions:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Switch to the &lsquo;Excel standard&lsquo; screen view by clicking on &lsquo;Preferences&rsquo; and then ensuring &lsquo;Excel standard&rsquo; is selected before clicking on the &lsquo;OK&rsquo; button</li>
     <li>Click on the coloured &lsquo;Photos&rsquo; tab at the bottom of the window. You will get a warning message - read it and click on the &lsquo;Continue&rsquo; button</li>
     <li>The information that needs to be updated is in the column headed &lsquo;Path&rsquo;. Each entry needs to be changed to be the correct path name for the operating system and file structure now being used. This can be done one entry at a time or if there are multiple entries that need changing to the same value, you can use the Excel &lsquo;Search and Replace&rsquo; &ndash; press &lsquo;Ctrl&rsquo; and &lsquo;H&rsquo;, enter the current path in the &lsquo;Find what&rsquo; field and the new path in the &lsquo;Replace with&rsquo; field and then click on &lsquo;Replace All&rsquo;</li>
     <li>Repeat the previous step if there are other paths that need to be changed</li>
     <li>The last 2 steps need to be repeated for the &lsquo;Docts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Multimedia&rsquo; tabs &ndash; you will not receive the warning message if you continue directly with these.</li>
    </ul>
  <h1><a name=3></a>3 Functions<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h1>
   <p>All functions are available from the menu on the main page &ndash; Click on the &lsquo;Cover&rsquo; tab if the menu is not displayed.</p>
   <p>The menu has 5 sub&ndash;menus:</p>
   <ul>

    <li>Edit</li>
    <li>Maintain</li>
    <li>Import</li>
    <li>Export</li>
   </ul>
   <p>and each of these has a list of relevant functions.  The required function is initiated by clicking on the appropriate button.</p>
   <p>An additional option &ndash; &lsquo;Check for updates&rsquo; &ndash; takes you to the application&rsquo;s web site where you have access to the latest downloadable version.</p>
   <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Unless &lsquo;Auto&ndash;save&rsquo; is turned On, changes made using functions on the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; and &lsquo;Maintain&rsquo; menus are not permanently saved to the database until the Excel file is saved to the computer&rsquo;s storage system.  This can easily be accomplished by clicking on the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; or &lsquo;Save &amp; Exit&rsquo; button.]</p>
   <h2><a name=3_1></a>3.1 View menu<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>Each function on the View menu will initially ask you to identify the individual that you want to base the view on.  A drop down list is available that lists all of the individuals in the database.  They are listed by Last Name, Other Names and Date of Birth.  Select the person that you want and then click on &lsquo;OK&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Each function returns to this person selection screen when you exit.  Either select another individual or click on &lsquo;Cancel&rsquo; to return to the main menu.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_1_1></a>3.1.1 Person<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>A window is displayed containing all of the recorded data about the person.  There are 6 tabs across the top of the page:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Main Details &ndash; shows simple demographic data such as name, birth and death</li>
      <li>Other Events &ndash; shows information about Baptism, Addresses, Occupations and Burial</li>
      <li>Family &ndash; shows parents and partners with marriage details</li>
      <li>Photographs &ndash; contains thumbnails of photos for this person</li>
      <li>Documents &ndash; contains thumbnails of documents for this person</li>
      <li>Multimedia &ndash; containing links to audio and video files for this person</li>
     </ul>
     <p>On the first 3 of these tabs, data about any sources recorded for a piece of information can be seen by clicking on the book icon next to the data.</p>
     <p>In most places where a GPS coordinate is shown, a button is available to open Google Maps at the appropriate geograpic location using the default web browser.</p>
     <p>On the Photographs, Documents and Multimedia tabs, clicking on a thumbnail will either open a window with a full size version of the image or open the file in its application.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_1_2></a>3.1.2 Tree<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>A new sheet is displayed showing a family tree centred on the selected individual.</p>
     <p>A maximum of 3 generations are shown, depending on how much data is available.  The individual&rsquo;s parents are shown in the top row with the individual and recorded partner(s) in the middle row and children at the bottom.  Individuals are coloured blue for Males, pink for Females and purple if sex is Unspecified and the linking lines show which relationship the children are from.  A double line linking the individual with a partner shows that they are recorded as having married.</p>
     <p>Right clicking on any individual displays the <a href='#3_1_1'>View Person</a> window, while just clicking on a person displays a tree based on that individual.</p>
     <p>Click the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button at the top left corner when you have finished with the tree.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_1_3></a>3.1.3 Ancestors<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This function displays a new sheet containing a diagram showing up to 6 generations of ancestors of the selected person.   This diagram may be large and it may be necessary to either reduce the screen &lsquo;zoom&rsquo; setting to below 100% or scroll down and right so that the whole diagram can be viewed.</p>
     <p>Older generations are shown to the right of the diagram &ndash; the heading row shows the relationship to the source individual and the number of individuals in the column.  Individuals are coloured blue for Males, pink for Females and purple if sex is Unspecified and the lines link an individual to their parents.  A dotted line round an individual shows that the individual also appears higher up in the diagram and probably indicates that multiple branches of the family have common ancestry.  An arrow &lsquo;>>&rsquo; in the right most column indicates that this person has at least 1 further generation of ancestors that is not shown.</p>
     <p>Right clicking on any individual displays the <a href='#3_1_1'>View Person</a> window, while just clicking on a person displays a tree based on that individual.</p>
     <p>Click the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button at the top left corner when you have finished with the diagram.</p>

     <p>This function displays a new sheet containing a diagram showing up to 5 generations of descendants of the selected person.</p>
     <p>Younger generations are shown to the right of the diagram. Individuals are coloured blue for Males, pink for Females and purple if sex is Unspecified. A line links a person to their partner(s) and lines from the partner link to the children from the relationship.  An arrow &lsquo;>>&rsquo; in the right most column indicates that this person has further descendants that are not shown.</p>
     <p>Right clicking on any individual displays the <a href='#3_1_1'>View Person</a> window, while just clicking on a person displays a tree based on that individual.</p>
     <p>Click the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button at the top left corner when you have finished with the diagram.</p>
   <h2><a name=3_2></a>3.2 Edit menu<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>The functions on this menu are used to record all of the data this captured about the individuals in the family tree.</p>
    <p>If it is required to record details of the sources of recorded information then these sources should be set up (using <a href='#3_3_1'>Edit Sources List</a>) before the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; functions are used.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_2_1></a>3.2.1 Add Person<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This function allows a new person to be added to the database.  When adding complete families, it is easier to add older generations first as the parents of younger generations can then be entered when the records for the individuals in these generations are created.</p>
     <p>A window is displayed with 6 tabs across the top of the page:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Main Details &ndash; records simple demographic data such as name, birth and death</li>
      <li>Other Events &ndash; records information about Baptism, Addresses, Occupations and Burial</li>
      <li>Family &ndash; records parents and partners with marriage details</li>
      <li>Photographs &ndash; allows photos to be added to this person&rsquo;s record</li>
      <li>Documents &ndash; allows documents to be added to this person&rsquo;s record</li>
      <li>Multimedia &ndash; allows audio and video files to be attached to the person&rsquo;s record</li>
     </ul>
     <p>The number shown at the top right is the unique identifier that will be assigned to the new individual.</p>
     <p>Data is entered on each of these tabs as detailed below and the new record is created by clicking on the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button.  Clicking on &lsquo;Cancel&rsquo; returns the user to the main menu without saving any data.</p>
     <h4><a name=Main_Details></a>Main Details<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h4>
      <p>All details are optional apart from the person&rsquo;s Sex &ndash; select from &lsquo;Male&rsquo;, &lsquo;Female&rsquo; and &lsquo;Unspecified&rsquo;.  Once a Sex has been selected, the other tabs become available and the window background is coloured blue, pink or purple based on the selected sex.</p>
      <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Clearly it is preferable to enter more details where they are known but this allows the creation of records for individuals that are known to be partners of other family members but no further information is available.]</p>
      <p>If entered, dates can be any valid <a href='#4_2_2'>date format</a>.  If a date of birth is not entered, it will be recorded as &lsquo;??&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>GPS coordinates are optional but if entered must be the latitude followed by longitude and separated by a comma. Latitude is entered as degrees north of the equator with points in the southern hemisphere using a negative number so the value must be between -90 and 90. Longitude is entered as degrees east of the Greenwich meridian with points to the west using a negative number so a value from -180 to 180 is allowed. For example &lsquo;-22.968063,-43.177779&rsquo; is a point on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and &lsquo;52.164154,1.578533&rsquo; is the Aldeburgh Golf Club, Club House in the East of England. <br>The &lsquo;map&rsquo; icon can be used in one of two ways:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>If no GPS coordinate has been entered, it gives access to a &lsquo;wizard&rsquo; to assist entry of the values</li>
        <li>If a GPS coordinate has been entered, then it initiates Google Maps, centred on the specified location in a separate browser window.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>All other fields are free text.  If a first name and/or family name is not entered, they will be recorded as &lsquo;??&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>The &lsquo;book&rsquo; icon can be clicked to allow the sources of the information to be recorded.  Any number of sources can be recorded for each data item.</p>
     <h4><a name=Other_Events></a>Other Events<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h4>
      <p>Each &lsquo;event&rsquo; is specified by selecting the type from the available list and then entering an optional date and details of the event.  Once these have been entered, click the &lsquo;Save to List&rsquo; button when the details will be added to the list of events at the bottom of the page.  Only events in this list will be saved to the database.</p>
      <p>When appropriate a GPS coordinate for the event can be entered and used as for the &lsquo;Main Details&rsquo; above.</p>
      <p>To change details of a previously entered event, click in it in the list and change the data at the top of the screen.  Click on &lsquo;Save to List&rsquo; when you have finished making the changes, when the item in the list is updated.</p>
      <p>The small arrows to the right of the list allow the currently selected event to be moved up or down in the list.</p>
      <p>Selecting an existing event item and then clicking on &lsquo;Delete from List&rsquo; will remove this event item from the list to be saved to the database.</p>
      <p>The &lsquo;source&rsquo; icon can be used to record information source(s) for each event.  Don&rsquo;t forget to click &lsquo;Save to List&rsquo; after these have been entered or changed.</p>
     <h4><a name=Family></a>Family<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h4>
      <p>Selecting either a Father or Mother from the available lists will change the value or options for the other parent as follows:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>if the selected parent has only one recorded partner, this person is used as the other parent</li>
       <li>if the selected parent has multiple recorded partners, these are available to choose from for the other parent</li>
       <li>if the selected parent has no recorded partner, then any available person of the opposite sex can be selected as the other parent [<b><i>Note:</i></b> In this case these parents will be automatically set up as partners]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Same sex partners cannot both be assigned as parents of an individual (the father must be male and the mother female).]</p>
      <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> A person whose sex is Unspecified cannot be assigned as a parent.]</p>
      <p>Selected parents can be changed by clicking on the appropriate &lsquo;Change&rsquo; button and selecting from the available list.</p>
      <p>Up to 4 partners can be recorded for a person, with a separate tab available for each relationship.  If the relationship is a same sex relationship, tick the box and the list of possible partners is updated accordingly.  Each partner can be selected from the list of individuals (use the &lsquo;Change&rsquo; button if an incorrect value has been entered).  If the partners were married, check the &lsquo;Married?&rsquo; box when marriage date, place and GPS coordinate can be entered.  If appropriate, divorce details can also be entered.  Details of information sources can be entered by clicking on the &lsquo;book&rsquo; icon.</p>
      <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Partners cannot be assigned to a person whose sex is Unspecified.]</p>
     <h4><a name=Photographs></a>Photographs<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h4>
      <p>Clicking the &lsquo;Add&rsquo; button shows a standard Windows file selection window.  Any number of images can be selected before clicking on the &lsquo;Open&rsquo; button.  The selected photos are then shown on the Photographs page.</p>
      <p>Clicking on the &lsquo;Caption&rsquo; button under a photograph allows a textual description to be added.  This is available when viewing photographs using the &lsquo;View Person&rsquo; function or on the web export.</p>
      <p>To remove a photograph from the person&rsquo;s record, check the box under the photograph(s) to be removed and then click on the &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; button.  [<b><i>Note:</i></b> this dos NOT delete the actual photograph but only removes the link to this person&rsquo;s record]</p>

    <h3><a name=3_2_2></a>3.2.2 Edit Person<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This function allows details to be changed for a person who is already on the database.</p>
     <p>The user is initially asked to select a person from a list of available individuals.</p>
     <p>Data is edited using much the same features as are available in the <a href='#3_2_1'>Add Person</a> function.  Changes are saved to the database by clicking on the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button.  Clicking on the &lsquo;Cancel&rsquo; button returns the user to the person selection option without saving any changes.</p>
     <p>An additional &lsquo;Delete&rsquo; button is also available.  If this is clicked, the user is asked to confirm the delete request and if they decide to continue, all traces of the individual are removed from the database.  If the person was a partner in a family that also had children then a &lsquo;dummy&rsquo; partner of the same sex is created to maintain the integrity of the family but if the family has no children it is deleted.</p>
   <h2><a name=3_3></a>3.3 Maintain menu<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>This menu provides a set of functions that allow the definition of personalised settings and assist with management of the database.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_3_1></a>3.3.1 Edit Sources List<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>Provides a facility to catalogue the sources from which information has been obtained.  Possible values may include:</p>

      <li>A family member</li>
      <li>A Birth certificate</li>
      <li>The International Genealogical Index</li>
     </ul>
     <p>A new source record can be created by clicking on &lsquo;&lt;new&gt;&rsquo; at the top of the list, entering a Title and Abbreviation and then clicking the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button.  The new source will be allocated the next index reference and added to the list.</p>
     <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> The rest of the application does not currently make use of the Abbreviation, but it is included for possible future use.  The GEDCOM standard already allows the optional specification of source abbreviations.]</p>
     <p>Details of an existing source can be changed by selecting the source from the list, editing the Title and Abbreviation and then clicking the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button.  <b>Beware:</b> Changing details of a source will automatically affect all individuals who have that source reference stored against a data item in their record.</p>
     <p>The positin of an item in the list can be modified by using the up and down arrow buttons to the right of the list.  This facility can be used to group similar types of source and position those that are more commonly used at the top of the list.</p>

    <h3><a name=3_3_4></a>3.3.4 Living Persons<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>When publishing family tree data to a web site it is possible to restrict the information that is made available for family members who are still alive.  This function allows you to indicate which individuals in the database are still alive.</p>
     <p>The system uses a number of criteria to decide which individuals may still be alive, these include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Is a known Date of Death absent?</li>
      <li>If they have a Date of Birth, are they older than the maximum age specified in <a href='#3_3_2'>Preferences</a>?</li>
      <li>If they do not have a Date of Birth, information such as marriage date, age of partner and age of children is used to calculate a probable age and this is compare against the maximum age specified in <a href='#3_3_2'>Preferences</a></li>
     </ul>
     <p>All individuals meeting these criteria are displayed.  A tick is displayed beside those that do not have an unknown Date of Death recorded.  Individuals in the list can be modified to indicate that they are or are not still alive.  When &lsquo;OK&rsquo; is clicked, an unknown Date of Death is recorded for all those in the list that are not indicated to be still alive.</p>
    <h3><a name=3_3_5></a>3.3.5 Validate<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This function checks the database for potential issues that may affect its performance or where the data is not complete or consistent.  If errors or warnings are found they are listed and give details of the page on which they appear, the record that has/had the issue, issue details and action taken.</p>
     <p>The database should always be validated immediately after <a href='#3_4_1'>Importing a GEDCOM</a> file or manually editing the database.</p>
     <p>In some cases, the issue can be automatically resolved and no further action is necessary.  Only those issues that have &lsquo;none&rsquo; in the Action column are of potential concern.  It is possible that these can be fixed by reading the section on <a href='#4_1'>Database Contents</a> and then manually editing the relevant database entry.</p>
     <p>If you cannot resolve issues identified by this facility, please send an email with full details of the problem and the cause (if known) to <a href="http://www.bishops-online.net/ContactForm.asp?Target=Support&amp;Subject=cvbFT v4.03 validation issue">me</a>.</p>
     <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> The validate function also performs some simple tidying of the database such as sorting the children in a family into date of birth order.] </p>

     <p>This facility allows the database to be populated with data from a GEDCOM file created by another family history application.</p>
     <p>GEDCOM is a specification for the communication of genealogical data.  It was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&ndash;day Saints and is an acronym for <i><b>Ge</b></i>nealogical <i><b>D</b></i>ata <i><b>Com</b></i>munication.

     <p>The function first uses a standard Windows file selection window to let you select the file to be imported.  The file must have a filename extension of &lsquo;.ged&rsquo;.</p>
     <p>A window is then displayed showing the number of individuals, families and sources that will be imported, together with a warning that <b>all existing data will be replaced</b>.  Clicking &lsquo;Continue&rsquo; starts the import.  When the import is complete, you are advised to run the <a href='#3_3_5'>Validate</a> function.</p>
     <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Even if Auto&ndash;save is turned ON, imported data is not permanently saved to the database until the Excel file is saved to the computer&rsquo;s storage system.  This can easily be accomplished by clicking on the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; or &lsquo;Save &amp; Exit&rsquo; button.]</p>

     <p>This function creates a GEDCOM file from the database that can be used to load the data into another GEDCOM compliant application.</p>
     <p>Clicking the &lsquo;Simple GEDCOM&rsquo; option will produce a file that does not include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Date ranges &ndash; these are truncated to the year at the end of the range</li>
      <li>Multiple Occupations &ndash; these are combined into a single field with no dates</li>

      <li>Burial data</li>
      <li>Source citations and list of sources</li> 
     </ul>
     <p>Although all of these data items are supported by the GEDCOM standard, some applications and web sites do not correctly support them and if problems are experienced with the full GEDCOM export, this simple version should work.</p>
     <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Same sex relationships and individuals with a sex of Unspecified are not supported by the GEDCOM standard and these relationships and individuals will not be included in the exported file.]</p>

    <h3><a name=3_5_2></a>3.5.2 HTML Web site<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This export function creates a series of files that use html (Hypertext Mark&ndash;up Language) that can be used to easily create a web site that can show your family history data.  The actual pages created for each individual depend on the options selected in <a href='#3_3_2'>Preferences</a>.</p>
     <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Depending on the number of individuals in your database and the processing power of your PC, this export may take a number of minutes.]</p>
     <p>Photos, Documents, Audio and Video files are copied from their original location to folders called &lsquo;Photos/images&rsquo;, &lsquo;Docts/images&rsquo; and &lsquo;Multimedia&rsquo; within the specified web export folder.  If the file already exists in this folder it is not overwritten.  This allows images for a web site to be resampled to reduce their size allowing faster download and display, so long as the oiginal name is retained.</p>
     <p>Once the export is complete, the contents of the Web export folder (specified in <a href='#3_3_2'>Preferences</a>) and all of its sub&ndash;folders should be copied to an appropriate location on your web server.</p>
   <h2><a name=3_6></a>3.6 Upgrade<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h2>
    <p>The upgrade function is only initiated by the application and cannot be activated by the user.  The following checks are performed:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Has an upgrade already been performed?</li>
     <li>Has the user requested that the application no longer ask about upgrades?</li>
     <li>Has a person already been added to the database?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the answer to all these is &lsquo;No&rsquo;, then the current folder is searched for an earlier version of cvbFT that contains at least one person.  If more than one is found, then that with the highest version number is used.  If an earlier version is found, the user is asked if they want to copy all of the data in to the new database.  If so, the upgrade is performed.</p>
    <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> When upgrading to v2.06 (or later) from a version earlier than v2.06, additional data will be added to the Photos and Docts sheets. Image files already exported for a web site will be relocated within the specified web folder structure. Any previously exported web pages should be regenerated using the standard <a href='#3_5_2'>HTML Web site</a> export function.]</p>
    <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> If you do want the upgrade facility to automatically copy your data from an earlier version of cvbFT, then the new version should be installed in the same folder as the existing database.]</p>
    <p>[<b><i>Note:</i></b> Copied data is not permanently saved to the new database until the Excel file is saved to the computer&rsquo;s storage system (Even if Auto&ndash;save is turned On).

    <p>The Excel Workbook contains 17 Worksheets.  9 of these are permanently unhidden (ie their coloured tabs are visible) and can be selected by the user.  Only the &lsquo;Cover&rsquo; sheet is protected to prevent modification as this holds no data and only acts as a menu providing access to the main functions.</p>
    <p>Whenever the current sheet is &lsquo;Cover&rsquo; and another of the database sheets is selected, a warning message about the risks of direct editing of data is displayed.</p>
    <p>Each of these is described in more detail below:</p>
    <h3><a name=4_1_1></a>4.1.1 Cover<a href='#top' class='gototop'>Contents</a></h3>
     <p>This sheet is always activated when the Workbook is opened, regardless of which sheet was active when it was last saved.</p>
     <p>This is the only sheet that has any form of protection.  All cells are formatted as &lsquo;Locked&rsquo; and the sheet is set to be protected.  This can be turned off using the standard Excel menu facility but most of the functions will turn protection back on.</p>
