My Java test and learn  project 

This was started when I strated to learn Java from the ground (it shows) now I going for becoming a "real" Java Dev and will build upon this.

It is a app for generating a dynasty tree (for use as a background of an RPG character, or just to populate a small medival hamlet) with code for the common heritage software appended at the end.
It generates a simple text file for now.


CURRENT STATUS: On hiatus until the frontend part of my "full-stack" dev course starts, some connection setup towards a webserver made (redhat openshift).

v. 0.1 Delivers basic output in a acceptable structure (this was created while taking an online VERY basic course). And I should really really refactor it <vince>.
